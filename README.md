#### Python Implementation of Variational Auto-Encoder

--------
A variational auto-encoder (VAE) is implemented in this repository for STA 663 final project. Our work includes:

- An implementation of VAE using NumPy
- Using Tensorflow and GPU to optimize the code
- Comparison to two other image reconstruction algorithms: Restricted Boltzman Machine (RBM) and Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks with Bayes by Backprop (BNN)
- We tested our VAE model on the simulated networks, MNIST and other real-world data sets.
